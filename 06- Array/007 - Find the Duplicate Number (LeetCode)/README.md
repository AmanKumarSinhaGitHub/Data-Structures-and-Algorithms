# [Find the Duplicate Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-duplicate-number/ "LeetCode")


### **Problem Description**

Given an array of integers `nums` containing `n + 1` integers, where each integer is in the range `[1, n]` inclusive, there is only one repeated number in the array. The task is to find and return this repeated number.

## Example

Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [1, 3, 4, 2, 2]
Output: 2
```

Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [3, 1, 3, 4, 2]
Output: 3
```

## Constraints

- 1 <= n <= 105
- nums.length == n + 1
- 1 <= nums[i] <= n
- All the integers in nums appear only once except for precisely one integer, which appears two or more times.
